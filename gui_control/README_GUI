CPUSaver is a program that runs as a daemon and monitors the open windows
that are running on the system. It uses the Xorg API to this. 
Basic behaviour: windows and their processes are kept in a list. When
a window has focus it is brought at the top of the list. If a window
goes down the list and excseeds the allowed number of windows (threshold)
the program either suspends, kills or slows down the process, depending
on the configuration file set by the user.

This directory contains the graphical user interface that helps configuring
the daemon. It writes the .cpusconfig according to the user preferences and 
it can start or stop the cpusaver daemon.

The GUI is written using the Qt framework. You will need the Qt libraries to run this program.
The Makefile, executable and object files are located in gui_control-Desktop-Debug directory
The source code and Qt project file are located inside the gui_control directory.

To build the gui control program, go into the gui_control-Desktop-Debug directory 
and type 'make' without quotes. The executable will be created in the directory.
This executable can then be run by launching gui_control.
